# pipinstall

pipinstall is a python shell script to quickly download dependencies in domains of computer science. Now we don't have to download libraries one by one or write a requirements.txt file!

### How to run:

Go to the cloned directory

open command line/powershell/terminal at that directory 

***Run:***

```python
python pipinstall.py domain_name
```

The domains must be one of the following:

| *Domain Names* | *Descriptions*                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| all            | Download all the libraries in the dependency.               |
| cryptography   | The safest encryption and cryptography libraries.           |
| games          | Make some games ;)                                          |
| gui            | Build beautiful Graphical User Interfaces.                  |
| img-vid        | Manipulate Images and videos with all the libraries around. |
| lib-manage     | Libraries to manage other libraries.                        |
| ml             | All the machine learning libraries you'll ever need.        |
| networking     | Connect and get connected all around :D                     |
| web-dev        | Build and run websites, both front and back xD              |

4. You're done. But if you want an easier access, 

   Set this repository as an environment variable and run:

   ```
   pipinstall.py domain_name
   ```
